## Session 3 (2nd April) Tracking beacons
Started off with a briefing on WhatsApp on how NDBs and VORs work and the advantages (not many with NDBs!) and disadvantages are.  Moved on to how to track them starting with nill wind.  Over to the sim where Timothy got me departing Duxford and then tracking BKY, LAM, DET and BIG

## Session 9 (16th April) ILS Approaches

## Session 10 (18th April) ILS Approaches & Procedures
After a quick catchup on Zoom, I had to demonstrate a couple of approaches in zero wind into Cambridge.  Performed a mixture of good, bad and mediocher approaches then moved on to discuss and fly in different wind scenerios including headwind, tail wind, 45 degree winds and cross winds.  X-Plane allows you to set winds by altidude so we set different directions for different altidudes e.g. surface 240 / 15 and 2000' 270 / 30.

We then moved on to missed approaches with pitch, power, gear and flaps, then tracking back to the inbound locator followed by a hold and then outbound back to intercept the ILS on the procedure.  Struggled with the hold again which still seems to be my achilles heel at the moment

## Session 11 (20th April) LOC & NDB Approaches & Procedures/approaches on GTN750
Usual quick catchup on Zoom with Timothy introducing me to the excelent [PBN Manual](https://pplir.org/download/649/) on PPL/IR.  Got a briefing on Localiser and NDB approaches and then performed on the sim.  Timothy had previously said if I maintained the same attitude and scan I did on an ILS approach that it would be easily transferable to an approach without a glidescope.  He was right (again!).

We then moved on to utilising the GTN750 for approaches.  I was very comfortable with this having spent a lot of time previously playing with it, however still learnt lots of tips.

Over on the sim we did the LOC 23 approach into cambridge.
